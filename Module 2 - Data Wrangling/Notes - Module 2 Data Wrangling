Learning Objective:
    1. Identify and handing missing values.
    2. Data Formatting
    3. Data Normaliztion (Centering/scaling)
    4. Data Binning
    5. Turing Categorical values to numerical variable.

    # Dealing with missing value in Python.
        i. What is missing value.
        ii. Missing value occur when no data value is stored for a variable (features) is an observation.
        iii. Could be repsented as "?", 0 or just blank cell.

    # How to deal with missing value.
        i. Check with the data collection source.
        ii. Drop the missing value.
            > Drop the variable
            > Drop the data entry
        iii. Replace the missing value.
            > Replace with Average value.
            > Replace it by frequency
            > Replace it with other function.
        Leave it as missing data

    # How to drop missing value in Python
        i. Use dropna() in dataframe.
            > Axis=0 drops the entire row
            > axis=1 drops the entire columns
    # How to replace missing value in Python
        i. Use replace() in dataframe.

    # Data Formatting:
        i. Data are usually collected from different palce and store in differnt formats.
        ii. Bringing data into a common standard of expression allows user to make meaningful comparison.

    # Data Types in Pandas
        i. Object : String or text e.g "A", "Hello"
        ii. Int64 : 1,2,3
        iii. Float64 : 2.50, 50.24

    # Data Normalization:
