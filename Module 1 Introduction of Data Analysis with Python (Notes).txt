Data Analysis with Python (IBM DA0101EN)
    In this module we will learn about:
          1. A problem requiring data analysis
          2. A dataset to be analyzed in Python
          3. Overview of Python Package for data Analysis
          4. Import and Export data in Python
          5. Basic Insights from the data
    Why Data Analysis?
         1. Data is everywhere
         2. Data Analysis / Data Science help us answer question from data.
         3. Data Analysis play important role in:
             i. Discovering useful information
             ii. Answer questions
             iii. Predicting future or the unknown.
